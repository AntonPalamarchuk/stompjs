\napplications.\nIntroduction\nThis library allows you to connect to a STOMP broker over WebSocket. This library\nsupports full STOMP specifications and all current protocol variants. Most\npopular messaging brokers support STOMP and STOMP over WebSockets either natively\nor using plugins.\nIn general JavaScript engines in browsers are not friendly to binary protocols,\nso using STOMP is a better option because it is a text oriented protocol.\nThis library was originally developed by Jeff Mesnil.\nCurrent Status\nThis library is feature complete and has been used in production for many years. It\nis actively maintained. You are welcome to file issues and submit pull requests.\nGetting started\nThe documentation is hosted as GitHub pages.\nYou may head straight to the \nentry point.\n(or with frames)\nThis library comes with detailed usage instructions. Please find it at \nUsage instructions. \nIf you were using older versions and wish to benefit from newer features, head to\nUpgrading. \nIf you are an existing user and will like to deep dive - API references for important entities:\n\nStomp\nClient\n\nNodeJS\nIf you are using this library in NodeJS you might need to make changes, please check\nUpgrading. \nUsage with Angular2/4/5\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs is based on this library and exposes the entire functionality\noffered by this library as Angular Services and rxjs Observables. Both these libraries are maintained\nby a similar set of contributors.\nTypeScript definitions\nThe npm package includes TypeScript definitions, so there is no need no install it separately.\nChange log\nPlease visit Change Log.\nContributing\nIf you want to understand the code, develop, or contribute.

Some messaging\nbrokers supports it out of the box while some may need special configuration \nor activating plugins. See STOMP Brokers for a non\nauthoritative list.\nInclude STOMP.js\nIn Web Browser\n\nDownload stomp.js\nor stomp.min.js\nInclude in your web page.\nStomp object will now be available. Read along to learn how to use it.\n\nIn NodeJS\n\nAdd npm modules @stomp/stompjs and websocket to your project.\n\nusing npm$ npm install @stomp/stompjs websocket --save\nusing yarn$ yarn add @stomp/stompjs websocket\n\n\nRequire the module\n  var Stomp = require('@stomp/stompjs');\nRead along to learn how to use the Stomp object.\n\nCreate a STOMP client\nSTOMP JavaScript clients will communicate to a STOMP server using a ws:// URL.\nTo create a STOMP client JavaScript object, you need to call Stomp.client(url)\n with the URL corresponding to the server's WebSocket endpoint:\n  var url = \"ws://localhost:15674/ws\";\n  var client = Stomp.client(url);The Stomp.client(url, protocols) can also be used to override the \ndefault subprotocols provided by the library: \n['v10.stomp', 'v11.stomp', 'v12.stomp'] (for STOMP 1.0, 1.1, & 1.2 \nspecifications). This second argument can either be a single string\n or an array of strings to specify multiple subprotocols.\nNotes: \n\nIn older versions of this library creating the client NodeJS was different.\nIf you need the old behavior please use version 3.x.x of the library.\nRecent versions of all web browsers and nodejs support WebSocket. However\nif you need to support older browsers, please see SockJS Support.\n\nConnection to the server\nOnce a STOMP client is created, it must call its connect() method to \neffectively connect and authenticate to the STOMP server. Usually the STOMP\n broker needs\n two arguments, login and passcode corresponding to the user\n  credentials. As per STOMP 1.2 host is mandatory, however many\n  STOMP brokers do not insist on this.\nBehind the scene, the client will open a connection using a WebSocket and send a\n CONNECT\nframe.\nThe connection is done asynchronously: you have no guarantee to be effectively\nconnected when the call to connect returns. To be notified of the connection, \nyou need to pass a connect_callback function to the connect() method:\n  var connect_callback = function() {\n    // called back after the client is connected and authenticated to the STOMP server\n  };But what happens if the connection fails? the connect() method accepts an\n  optional error_callback argument which will be called if the client is not able\n  to connect to the server.\n  The callback will be called with a single argument, an error object \n  corresponding to STOMP\n  ERROR frame:\n  var error_callback = function(error) {\n    // display the error's message header:\n    alert(error.headers.message);\n  };The connect() method accepts different number of arguments to provide a simple \nAPI to use in most cases:\n  client.connect(login, passcode, connectCallback);\n  client.connect(login, passcode, connectCallback, errorCallback);\n  client.connect(login, passcode, connectCallback, errorCallback, closeEventCallback);\n  client.connect(login, passcode, connectCallback, errorCallback, closeEventCallback, host);where login, passcode and host are strings. connectCallback and\nerrorCallback is a function which will receive a Frame as argument and \ncloseEventCallback is a function which will receive a CloseEvent\nThe connect() method also accepts two other variants if you need\n to pass additional headers:\n  client.connect(headers, connectCallback);\n  client.connect(headers, connectCallback, errorCallback);\n  client.connect(headers, connectCallback, errorCallback, closeEventCallback);where header is a map. connectCallback and\nerrorCallback is a function which will receive a Frame as argument and \ncloseEventCallback is a function which will receive a CloseEvent\nPlease note that if you use these forms, you will typically add login,\n passcode (and host) headers yourself:\n    var headers = {\n      login: 'mylogin',\n      passcode: 'mypasscode',\n      // additional header\n      'client-id': 'my-client-id'\n    };\n    client.connect(headers, connectCallback);To disconnect a client from the server, you can call its disconnect()\n method. The disconnection is asynchronous: to be notified when \n the disconnection is effective, the disconnect method takes an \n optional callback argument.\n  client.disconnect(function() {\n    alert(\"See you next time!\");\n  });When a client is disconnected, it can no longer send or receive messages.\nHeart-beating\nIf the STOMP broker accepts STOMP 1.1 or higher frames, \nheart-beating is enabled by default.\nThe client object has a heartbeat field which can be used to configure \nheart-beating by changing its incoming and outgoing integer fields \n(default value for both is 10,000ms). These can be disabled by setting to 0.\n    client.heartbeat.outgoing = 20000; // client will send heartbeats every 20000ms\n    client.heartbeat.incoming = 0;     // client does not want to receive heartbeats\n                                       // from the serverAuto Reconnect\nThe client supports automatic reconnecting in case of a connection failure. It is\ncontrolled by a field reconnect_delay. Default value is 0, which indicates auto\nreconnect is disabled.\n  // Add the following if you need automatic reconnect (delay is in milli seconds)\n  client.reconnect_delay = 5000;Send messages\nWhen the client is connected to the server, it can send STOMP messages using\n  the send() method. The method takes a mandatory destination\n  argument corresponding to the STOMP destination. It also takes two optional\n  arguments: headers, a JavaScript object containing additional\n  message headers and body, a String.\n  client.send(\"/queue/test\", {priority: 9}, \"Hello, STOMP\");The client will send a STOMP \nSEND\nframe to /queue/test destination with a header priority set to 9 and\n a body Hello, STOMP.\nIf you want to send a message with a body, you must also pass the headers\n argument. If you have no headers to pass, use an empty JavaScript literal {}:\n  client.send(destination, {}, body);Subscribe and receive messages\nTo receive messages in the browser, the STOMP client must first subscribe to \na destination.\nYou can use the subscribe() method to subscribe to a destination. The method\ntakes 2 mandatory arguments: destination, a String corresponding to the \ndestination and callback, a function with one message argument and an optional\nargument headers, a JavaScript object for additional headers.\n  var subscription = client.subscribe(\"/queue/test\", callback);The subscribe() methods returns a JavaScript object with one attribute, id, \nthat correspond to the client subscription ID and one method unsubscribe() \nthat can be used later on to unsubscribe the client from this destination.\nBy default, the library will generate an unique ID if there is none provided\nin the headers. To use your own ID, pass it using the headers argument:\n  var mysubid = 'my-subscription-id-001';\n  var subscription = client.subscribe(destination, callback, { id: mysubid });The client will send a STOMP \nSUBSCRIBE \nframe to the server and register the callback. Every time the server sends \na message to the client, the client will in turn call the callback with a \nSTOMP Frame object corresponding to the message:\n  callback = function(message) {\n    // called when the client receives a STOMP message from the server\n    if (message.body) {\n      alert(\"got message with body \" + message.body)\n    } else {\n      alert(\"got empty message\");\n    }\n  };The subscribe() method takes an optional headers argument to specify \nadditional headers when subscribing to a destination:\n  var headers = {ack: 'client', 'selector': \"location = 'Europe'\"};\n  client.subscribe(\"/queue/test\", message_callback, headers);The client specifies that it will handle the message acknowledgement and \nis interested to receive only messages matching the selector location = 'Europe'.\nIf you want to subscribe the client to multiple destinations, you can use\nthe same callback to receive all the messages:\n  onmessage = function(message) {\n    // called every time the client receives a message\n  };\n\n  var sub1 = client.subscribe(\"queue/test\", onmessage);\n  var sub2 = client.subscribe(\"queue/another\", onmessage);To stop receiving messages, the client can use the unsubscribe() method on \nthe object returned by the subscribe() method.\n  var subscription = client.subscribe(\"queue/test\", onmessage);\n\n  // ... use the subscription ...\n\n  subscription.unsubscribe();JSON support\nThe body of a STOMP message must be a String. If you want to send and receive\nJSON objects, you can use JSON.stringify() and \nJSON.parse() to transform the JSON object to a String and vice versa.\n  var quote = {symbol: 'APPL', value: 195.46};\n  client.send(\"/topic/stocks\", {}, JSON.stringify(quote));\n\n  client.subcribe(\"/topic/stocks\", function(message) {\n    var quote = JSON.parse(message.body);\n    alert(quote.symbol + \" is at \" + quote.value);\n  });Acknowledgment\nBy default, STOMP messages will be automatically acknowledged by the server\nbefore the message is delivered to the client.\nThe client can choose instead to handle message \nacknowledgement by subscribing \nto a destination and specify a ack header set to client or \nclient-individual.\nIn that case, the client must use the message.ack() method to inform the \nserver that it has acknowledge the message. This method sends an \nACK Frame to the\nbroker.\n  var subscription = client.subscribe(\"/queue/test\",\n    function(message) {\n      // do something with the message\n      // ...\n      // and acknowledge it\n      message.ack();\n    },\n    {ack: 'client'}\n  );The ack() method accepts a headers argument for additional headers to \nacknowledge the message. For example, it is possible to acknowledge a \nmessage as part of a transaction and ask for a receipt when the ACK STOMP \nframe has effectively be processed by the broker:\n  var tx = client.begin();\n  message.ack({ transaction: tx.id, receipt: 'my-receipt' });\n  tx.commit();The message.nack() method can also be used to inform STOMP 1.1 or higher\nbrokers that the client did not consume the message using a\nNACK Frame. It \ntakes the same arguments than the ack() method.\nTransactions\nMessages can be sent and acknowledged in a transaction.\nA transaction is started by the client using its begin() method which \ntakes an optional transaction_id, a String which uniquely identifies the \ntransaction. If no transaction_id is passed, the library will generate \none automatically.\nThis methods returns a JavaScript object with an id attribute corresponding\nto the transaction ID and two methods:\n\ncommit() to commit the transaction\nabort() to abort the transaction\n\nThe client can then send and/or acknowledge messages in the transaction\nby specifying a transaction set with the transaction id.\n  // start the transaction\n  var tx = client.begin();\n  // send the message in a transaction\n  client.send(\"/queue/test\", {transaction: tx.id}, \"message in a transaction\");\n  // commit the transaction to effectively send the message\n  tx.commit();If you forget to add the transaction header when calling send() the message\nwill not be part of the transaction and will be sent directly without waiting\nfor the completion of the transaction.\n  var txid = \"unique_transaction_identifier\";\n  // start the transaction\n  var tx = client.begin();\n  // oops! send the message outside the transaction\n  client.send(\"/queue/test\", {}, \"I thought I was in a transaction!\");\n  tx.abort(); // Too late! the message has been sentDebug\nThere are few tests in the code and it is helpful to see what is sent and \nreceived from the library to debug application.\nThe client can set its debug property to a function with takes a String \nargument to see all the debug statements of the library:\n  client.debug = function(str) {\n    // append the debug log to a #debug div somewhere in the page using JQuery:\n    $(\"#debug\").append(str + \"\\n\");\n  };By default, the debug messages are logged in the browser window's console.\nOn a busy system the logs can be overwhelming, to disable logging, set it to\nan empty function:\n  client.debug = function(str) {};\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/stomp-brokers.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/stomp-brokers.html","title":"additional-page - STOMP Brokers","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroker Requirements\nInformation on this page is outdated, please refer to your broker documentation\nfor up to date information.\nThis library is not a pure STOMP client. It is aimed to run on the \nWebSockets protocol which is not TCP. Basically, the WebSocket protocol \nrequires a handshake between the browser's client and the server to \nensure the browser's \"same-origin\" security model remains in effect.\nThis means that this library can not connect to regular STOMP brokers \nsince they would not understand the handshake initiated by the WebSocket \nwhich is not part of the STOMP protocol and would likely reject the \nconnection.\nThere are ongoing works to add WebSocket support to STOMP broker so \nthat they will accept STOMP connections over the WebSocket protocol.\nHornetQ\nHornetQ is the Open Source messaging system \ndeveloped by Red Hat and JBoss.\nTo start HornetQ with support for STOMP Over WebSocket, \ndownload the latest version \nand run the following steps:\n  $ cd hornetq-x.y.z/examples/jms/stomp-websockets\n  $ mvn clean install\n  ...\n  INFO: HQ221020: Started Netty Acceptor version 3.6.2.Final-c0d783c localhost:61614 for STOMP_WS protocol\n  Apr 15, 2013 1:15:33 PM org.hornetq.core.server.impl.HornetQServerImpl$SharedStoreLiveActivation run\n  INFO: HQ221007: Server is now live\n  Apr 15, 2013 1:15:33 PM org.hornetq.core.server.impl.HornetQServerImpl start\n  INFO: HQ221001: HornetQ Server version 2.3.0.CR2 (black'n'yellow2, 123) [c9e29e45-a5bd-11e2-976a-b3fef7ceb5df]HornetQ is now started and listens to STOMP over WebSocket on the port 61614.It accepts WebSocket connections from the URL ws://localhost:61614/stomp\nTo configure and run HornetQ with STOMP Over WebSocket enabled, follow the \ninstructions.\nActiveMQ\nActiveMQ is the Open Source messaging system \ndeveloped by Apache.

If your\napplication does not need to support old browsers, switch to using\nWebSockets. Check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket for compatibility \ninformation.\nWeb browsers supports different versions of the WebSocket protocol. Some \nolder browsers does not provide the WebSocket JavaScript or expose it \nunder another name. By default, stomp.js will use the Web browser native \nWebSocket class to create the WebSocket.\nHowever it is possible to use other type of WebSockets by using the \nStomp.over(ws) method. This method expects an object that conforms \nto the WebSocket definition.\nFor example, it is possible to use the implementation provided by the \nSockJS project which falls \nback to a variety of browser-specific transport protocols instead:\n    // use SockJS implementation instead of the browser's native implementation\n    var client = Stomp.over(function(){\n        return new SockJS(url);\n    });Use Stomp.client(url) to use regular WebSockets or use Stomp.over(ws_fn) \nif you required another type of WebSocket.\nApart from this initialization, the STOMP API remains the same in both cases.\nLimitations of SockJS\n\nSockJS is an emulation of WebSockets. This is not a complete implementation.\nHeart beating is not supported.\nSockJS internally uses one of many possible means to communicate. In some of\nthose, auto reconnect may occasionally fail.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/change-log.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/change-log.html","title":"additional-page - Change Log","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Log\n4.0.6 (2018/05/26)\n\nUpdates in typescript definitions, Thanks Raul,\nsee: #39\n\n4.0.5\n\nIgnore - incomplete release\n\n4.0.4 (2018/05/22)\n\nGWT Compatibility, fixes #38\n\n4.0.3 (2018/05/09)\n\nAdd to Bower, fixes #26\nSeveral documentation cleanup, fixes #27\nUpdated typescript definitions, Thanks Jimi Charalampidis.\nSee: #33\nI need to be more disciplined.
