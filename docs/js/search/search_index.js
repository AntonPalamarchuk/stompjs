node.js.\napplications.\nIntroduction\nThis repository is for version 5 and above of this library.\nFor version 3/4 of this library is maintained at https://github.com/stomp-js/stomp-websocket.\nThis library allows you to connect to a STOMP broker over WebSocket. This library\nsupports full STOMP specifications and all current protocol variants. Most\npopular messaging brokers support STOMP and STOMP over WebSockets either natively\nor using plugins.\nIn general JavaScript engines in browsers are not friendly to binary protocols,\nso using STOMP is a good option because it is a text oriented protocol.\nThis library has its roots in a version released by Jeff Mesnil.\nCurrent Status\nVersion 5 of this library has been bottom up rewritten using TypeScript (versions 3/4\nuse CoffeeScript). The code has substantially changed, so, while there is a compatibility\nmode, you might need to update your code.\nThis library is feature complete and has been used in production for many years. It\nis actively maintained. You are welcome to file issues and submit pull requests.\nUpgrading\nif you were using an older version of this library, you would need to make changes\nto your code. Head to\nUpgrading\nGetting started\nThe documentation is hosted as GitHub pages.\nYou may head straight to the https://stomp-js.github.io/stompjs/\nThis library comes with detailed usage instructions. Please find it at \nUsage instructions. \nThere are quite detailed API documentation,\nyou should start at https://stomp-js.github.io/stompjs/classes/Client.html.\nUsage with Angular2/4/5\nhttps://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs is based on this library and exposes the entire functionality\noffered by this library as Angular Services and rxjs Observables. Both these libraries are maintained\nby a similar set of contributors.\nTypeScript definitions\nThe npm package includes TypeScript definitions, so there is no need no install it separately.\nChange log\nPlease visit Change Log.\nContributing\nIf you want to understand the code, develop, or contribute.

Some messaging\nbrokers supports it out of the box while some may need special configuration \nor activating plugins.\nInclude STOMP.js\nIn Web Browser\n\nDownload or directly include one of [CDN links] or from bundles/ folder.\nStompJs object will now be available. Read along to learn how to use it.\n\nPollyfills\n\nObject.assign.\nIt is not supported by IE (supported by Edge).\nIt will need to be polyfilled from npm package es6-object-assign. A simple approach:  \nTextEncoder\nand\nTextDecoder.\nThese are not supported by any of the MicroSoft browsers as of 2018.\nThese will need to be polyfilled from npm package text-encoding. A simple approach:  \n\nIn NodeJS\n\nAdd npm modules @stomp/stompjs, websocket and text-encoding to your project.\n  $ npm install @stomp/stompjs websocket text-encoding\nRequire the module\n      // This is simplest way to get going\n      WebSocket = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket;\n\n      // There is a proposal to add these by default in NodeJS, so good idea is to check first\n      if (typeof TextEncoder !== 'function') {\n        const TextEncodingPolyfill = require('text-encoding');\n        TextEncoder = TextEncodingPolyfill.TextEncoder;\n        TextDecoder = TextEncodingPolyfill.TextDecoder;\n      }\n\n      StompJs = require('@stomp/stompjs/esm5/');  \nRead along to learn how to use the StompJs object.\n\nSetting/getting options\nAll options can be set/get by directly operating on the client instance:\n    const client = new StompJs.Client();\n    client.brokerURL = \"ws://localhost:15674/ws\";\n\n    console.log(client.brokerURL);These can also be set passing key/value pairs to Client constructor\nor to Client#configure.\nCreate a STOMP client\nSTOMP JavaScript clients will communicate to a STOMP server using a ws:// or wss:// URL.\n    const client = new StompJs.Client({\n      brokerURL: \"ws://localhost:15674/ws\",\n      connectHeaders: {\n        login: \"user\",\n        passcode: \"password\"\n      },\n      debug: function (str) {\n        console.log(str);\n      },\n      reconnectDelay: 5000,\n      heartbeatIncoming: 4000,\n      heartbeatOutgoing: 4000\n    });\n\n    client.onConnect = function(frame) {\n      // Do something, all subscribes must be done is this callback\n      // This is needed because this will be executed after a (re)connect\n    };\n\n    client.onStompError = function (frame) {\n      // Will be invoked in case of error encountered at Broker\n      // Bad login/passcode typically will cause an error\n      // Complaint brokers will set `message` header with a brief message. Body may contain details.\n      // Compliant brokers will terminate the connection after any error\n      console.log('Broker reported error: ' + frame.headers['message']);\n      console.log('Additional details: ' + frame.body);\n    };\n\n    client.activate();To deactivate a client call Client#deactivate.\nIt will stop sttempting to reconnect and disconnect if there is an active connection.\n    client.deactivate();Send messages\nWhen the client is connected to the server, it can send STOMP messages using\nthe Client#publish method.\n    client.publish({destination: '/topic/general', body: 'Hello world'});\n\n    // There is an option to skip content length header\n    client.publish({destination: '/topic/general', body: 'Hello world', skipContentLengthHeader: true});\n\n    // Additional headers\n    client.publish({destination: '/topic/general', body: 'Hello world', headers: {'priority': '9'}});Starting version 5, sending binary messages is supported.\nTo send a binary message body use binaryBody parameter. It should be a\nUint8Array.\n    var binaryData = generateBinaryData(); // This need to be of type Uint8Array\n    // setting content-type header is not mandatory, however a good practice\n    client.publish({destination: '/topic/special', binaryBody: binaryData,\n                    headers: {'content-type': 'application/octet-stream'}});Subscribe and receive messages\nTo receive messages in the browser, the STOMP client must first subscribe to \na destination.\nYou can use the Client#subscribe method to subscribe to a destination. The method\ntakes 2 mandatory arguments: destination, a String corresponding to the \ndestination and callback, a function with one message argument and an optional\nargument headers, a JavaScript object for additional headers.\n  var subscription = client.subscribe(\"/queue/test\", callback);The subscribe() methods returns a JavaScript object with one attribute, id, \nthat correspond to the client subscription ID and one method unsubscribe() \nthat can be used later on to unsubscribe the client from this destination.\nEvery time the server sends \na message to the client, the client will in turn invoke the callback with a \nMessage object.\n  callback = function(message) {\n    // called when the client receives a STOMP message from the server\n    if (message.body) {\n      alert(\"got message with body \" + message.body)\n    } else {\n      alert(\"got empty message\");\n    }\n  };The subscribe() method takes an optional headers argument to specify \nadditional headers when subscribing to a destination:\n  var headers = {ack: 'client'};\n  client.subscribe(\"/queue/test\", message_callback, headers);The client specifies that it will handle the message acknowledgement.\nTo stop receiving messages, the client can use the \nunsubscribe method on \nthe object returned by the Client#subscribe method.\n  var subscription = client.subscribe(\"queue/test\", onmessage);\n\n  // ... use the subscription ...\n\n  subscription.unsubscribe();Binary messages\nPrep your broker\nNot every broker will support binary messages out of the box.\nFor example RabbitMQ (see: https://www.rabbitmq.com/web-stomp.html)\nwill need following to be added to the server configuration:\nweb_stomp.ws_frame = binaryPublishing binary messages\nUse parameter binaryBody of Client#publish to send binary data of type\nUint8Array.\nSee Send messages for an example.\nReceiving binary messages\nThe library does not try to guess whether the incoming data is text/binary.\nWhen you access Message#body the message will be returned as string.\nTo access the message body as binary please call Message#binaryBody.\nThere is no generally accepted convention in STOMP (actually messaging in general) to indicate that a message\nis binary. The message senders and receivers will need to agree on required convention.\nYou may choose to set content-type header to indicate binary message.\n    // within message callback\n    if (message.headers['content-type'] === 'application/octet-stream') {\n      // message is binary\n      // call message.binaryBody \n    } else {\n      // message is text\n      // call message.body\n    }JSON support\nThe body of a STOMP message must be a String. If you want to send and receive\nJSON objects, you can use JSON.stringify() and \nJSON.parse() to transform the JSON object to a String and vice versa.\n  var quote = {symbol: 'APPL', value: 195.46};\n  client.send(\"/topic/stocks\", {}, JSON.stringify(quote));\n\n  client.subcribe(\"/topic/stocks\", function(message) {\n    var quote = JSON.parse(message.body);\n    alert(quote.symbol + \" is at \" + quote.value);\n  });Acknowledgment\nBy default, STOMP messages will be automatically acknowledged by the server\nbefore the message is delivered to the client.\nThe client can choose instead to handle message \nacknowledgement by subscribing \nto a destination and specify a ack header set to client or \nclient-individual.\nIn that case, the client must use the Message#ack method to inform the \nserver that it has processed the message.\n  var subscription = client.subscribe(\"/queue/test\",\n    function(message) {\n      // do something with the message\n      // ...\n      // and acknowledge it\n      message.ack();\n    },\n    {ack: 'client'}\n  );The Message#ack method accepts headers argument for additional headers.\nFor example, it is possible to acknowledge a \nmessage as part of a transaction and ask for a receipt when the ACK has effectively been processed by the broker:\n  var tx = client.begin();\n  message.ack({ transaction: tx.id, receipt: 'my-receipt' });\n  tx.commit();The Message#nack method can also be used to inform STOMP 1.1 or higher\nbrokers that the client did not consume the message. It \ntakes the same arguments than the Message#ack method.\nTransactions\nMessages can be sent and acknowledged in a transaction.\nA transaction is started by the client using its Client#begin method which \ntakes an optional transaction_id.\nThis methods returns a JavaScript object with an id attribute corresponding\nto the transaction ID and two methods:\n\nClient#commit to commit the transaction\nClient#abort to abort the transaction\n\nThe client can then send and/or acknowledge messages in the transaction\nby specifying a transaction set with the transaction id.\n  // start the transaction\n  var tx = client.begin();\n  // send the message in a transaction\n  client.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", headers: {transaction: tx.id}, body: \"message in a transaction\"});\n  // commit the transaction to effectively send the message\n  tx.commit();If you forget to add the transaction header when calling Client#publish the message\nwill not be part of the transaction and will be sent directly without waiting\nfor the completion of the transaction.\n  // start the transaction\n  var tx = client.begin();\n  // oops! send the message outside the transaction\n  client.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", body: \"message in a transaction\"});\n  tx.abort(); // Too late! the message has been sentHeart-beating\nIf the STOMP broker accepts STOMP 1.1 or higher frames, \nheart-beating is enabled by default.\nOptions Client#heartbeatIncoming\nand Client#heartbeatOutgoing\ncan be used to control heart-beating\n(default value for both is 10,000ms). These can be disabled by setting to 0.\n    client.heartbeatOutgoing = 20000; // client will send heartbeats every 20000ms\n    client.heartbeatIncoming = 0;     // client does not want to receive heartbeats\n                                       // from the serverAuto Reconnect\nThe client supports automatic reconnecting in case of a connection failure. It is\ncontrolled by a option Client#reconnectDelay.\nDefault value is 5000ms, which indicates that\na attempt to connect will be made after 5000ms of a connection drop.\n  // Add the following if you need automatic reconnect (delay is in milli seconds)\n  client.reconnectDelay = 300;This can be set quite small.\nDebug\nThe client can set its Client#debug property to a function with takes a String \nargument to see all the debug statements of the library:\n  client.debug = function(str) {\n    console.log(str);\n  };By default, the debug messages are ignored.\nOn a busy system the logs can be overwhelming.\nCallbacks\nLifecycle callbacks\n\nClient#beforeConnect - invoked each time before \nconnection to STOMP broker is attempted. You can modify connection parameters and other callbacks.\nClient#onConnect - invoked for each time STOMP broker connects and\nSTOMP handshake is complete\nClient#onDisconnect - invoked after each graceful disconnection.\nIf the connection breaks because of an error or network failure, it will no tbe called.\nClient#onStompError - invoked when the broker reports an Error\nClient#onWebSocketClose  - when the WebSocket closes.\nIt is most reliable way of knowing that the connection has terminated.\n\nFrame callbacks\n\nClient#onUnhandledMessage - typically brokers will send messages\ncorresponding to subscriptions. \nHowever, brokers may support concepts that are beyond standard definition of STOMP -\nfor example RabbitMQ support concepts of temporary queues.\nIf any message is received that is not linked to a subscription, this callback will be invoked.\nClient#onUnhandledReceipt - you should prefer\nClient#watchForReceipt. If there is any incoming receipt for\nwhich there is no active watcher, this callback will be invoked.\nClient#treatMessageAsBinary - invoked for each incoming\nmessage, depending on the outcome, the body is returned as string or Uint8Array. The default implementation\nalways returns false.\nClient#onUnhandledFrame - it will be invoked if broker sends a\nnon standard STOMP command.\n\nAdvanced notes\nThe version 5 of this library has taken significant variation from previous syntax. This version allows\nall of the options and callbacks to be altered.\nNew values will take effect as soon as possible. For example:\n\nAltered values of Client#onUnhandledMessage \nor Client#onDisconnect will be effective immediately.\nNew values of Client#heartbeatIncoming\nand Client#heartbeatOutgoing will be used next time STOMP connects.\n\nThe callback sequences are arranged in a way that most expected operations should work.\nFor example it is possible to call Client#deactivate\nwithin Client#onStompError\nor Client#onWebSocketClose.\nThis is useful if we determine that we have incorrect credentials and no point keep on trying to connect.\nThe above also allows readjusting Client#reconnectDelay\nin Client#onWebSocketClose.\nThis can be used to implement exponential back-off before each successive reconnect attempt.\nEven Client#brokerURL\nor Client#connectHeaders\ncan be altered which would get used in a subsequent reconnect.\nHowever, I will suggest creating a new instance of the STOMP client in this scenario.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/upgrading.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/upgrading.html","title":"additional-page - Upgrading","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade (Work in Progress)\nUpgrading from version 3/4\nThis version uses newer Javascript features. Few these can be pollyfilled in older\nbrowsers.\nHowever Uint8Array\nis critically needed and not possible to be efficiently pollyfilled  (notably in IE9 or lower).\nIf you need to support any browser that does not have native support for Uint8Array\nplease continue using version 4 of this library.\nBasic changes\nPlease follow section Include STOMP.js to add latest version\nand to include necessary polyfills.\nThe following is for convenience - to keep the code change to the minimum.\n    // Depending on your JS version you may have to use var instead of const \n\n    // To use compatibility mode\n    const Stomp = StompJs.Stomp;For the lazy: use the compatibility mode\nWith the changes above, your code should now work. If you face issues please\nraise an issue at https://github.com/stomp-js/stompjs/issues\nNote: no new features will be added to the compatibility mode.\nAttempt would be made so that code working in version 3/4 continue\nto work. The compatibility mode will be maintained for a year.\nTake control: proper upgrade\nThis section covers rationale of new features and \nchanges needed to take full advantage.\nCreating a client and connecting\nIn version 3/4 typically a client instance is created and one of the\nvariants of connect is called.\nOver the years connect has gotten many variants with different\ncombination of parameters.\nThe new version makes all options settable on client instance.\nThese options can be passed during creation of a client or while\ncalling client.activate.\nOld\n    const client = Stomp.client(\"ws://localhost:15674/ws\");\n\n    client.debug =  function (str) {\n      console.log(str);\n    };\n\n    client.heartbeat.incoming = 4000;\n    client.heartbeat.outgoing = 4000;\n\n    client.reconnect_delay = 5000;\n\n    client.connect(\"user\", \"password\",\n      function () {\n        // Do something\n      });Updated\n    const client = new StompJs.Client({\n      brokerURL: \"ws://localhost:15674/ws\",\n      connectHeaders: {\n        login: \"user\",\n        passcode: \"password\"\n      },\n      debug: function (str) {\n        console.log(str);\n      },\n      reconnectDelay: 5000,\n      heartbeatIncoming: 4000,\n      heartbeatOutgoing: 4000\n    });\n\n    client.onConnect = function(frame) {\n    // Do something\n    };\n\n    client.activate();Please see StompConfig for all possible options.\nThese options can be set onto client.\nAlternatively these can be passed\nas options to the Client constructor constructor,\nthe Client#activate\nor the Client#deactivate calls.\nIf you want to set options in bulk you can use Client#configure.\nPublishing messages\nOld\n    client.send('/topic/general', {}, 'Hello world');\n\n    // Skip content length header\n    client.send('/topic/general', {'content-length': false}, 'Hello world');\n\n    // Additional headers\n    client.send('/topic/general', {'priority': '9'}, 'Hello world');Updated\n    client.publish({destination: '/topic/general', body: 'Hello world'});\n\n    // There is an option to skip content length header\n    client.publish({destination: '/topic/general', body: 'Hello world', skipContentLengthHeader: true});\n\n    // Additional headers\n    client.publish({destination: '/topic/general', body: 'Hello world', headers: {'priority': '9'}});Semantic changes\n\nStomp.client --> Client constructor\nand Client#brokerURL\nStomp.over --> Client constructor\nand Client#webSocketFactory\nconnect --> Client#activate\nlogin, passcode, host --> Client#connectHeaders\nconnectCallback --> Client#onConnect \nerrorCallback --> Client#onStompError\ncloseEventCallback --> Client#onWebSocketClose \n\n\ndisconnect --> Client#deactivate\ndisconnectCallback --> Client#onDisconnect\n\n\nsend --> Client#publish\n\nName changes\nThese changes have been carried out in order to make a consistent naming convention (lowerCamelCase)\nand to make meaning of the option clearer.\n\nreconnect_delay --> Client#reconnectDelay\nws --> Client#webSocket\nversion --> Client#connectedVersion\nonreceive --> Client#onUnhandledMessage\nonreceipt --> Client#onUnhandledReceipt\nheartbeat.incoming --> Client#heartbeatIncoming\nheartbeat.outgoing --> Client#heartbeatOutgoing\n\nDropped APIs\n\nmaxWebSocketFrameSize -  large messages\nwork without this. Test cases have been added to test large text and binary messages.\n\nMigrating from Version 2\nYou will need to follow the instructions above with few additional considerations.\nPlease note:\n\nAuto reconnect is switched on by default.\nSet Client#reconnectDelay to 0 to disable.\nAfter each connect (i.e., initial connect as well each reconnection) the \nClient#onConnect (connectCallback in earlier versions)\nwill be called.\nAfter reconnecting, it will not automatically subscribe to queues that were subscribed.\nSo, if all subscriptions are part of the \nClient#onConnect (which it would in most of the cases),\nyou will not need to do any additional handling.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nStomp.overWS is same as Stomp.client. Follow the instructions for Stomp.client above.\nNodeJS is supported at same level as browser. Test suits are executed for both NodJS and browser.\nFollow the instructions as above.\nStomp.overTCP is no longer supported. If your brokers supports WebStomp (STOMP over WebSocket),\nyou may switch to that.\nIf you are using SockJS please also see SockJS support\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/sockjs-support.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/sockjs-support.html","title":"additional-page - SockJS Support","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Web browser with a custom WebSocket\nAs of 2018, WebSocket support in browsers is nearly ubiquitous.\nPlease check https://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets.\nDepending on your user base you can skip this page.\nYou can use SockJS\nto support browsers that do not natively support WebSockets.\nYou would need to consider the following:\n\nURL protocol conventions are different for WebSockets (ws:/wss:) and SockJS (http: or https:).\nInternal handshake sequences are different - so, some brokers will use different end points for\nboth protocols.\nNeither of these allow custom headers to be set during the HTTP handshake.\nSockJS internally supports different transport mechanisms.
